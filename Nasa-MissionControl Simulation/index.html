  <h2>ABOUT THE GAME</h2>
  <p>
    This simulation was made as an attempt to show
    the beauty of the launch sequence.
    Many people have seen the launches but are not
    exactly aware of how amazing the process really is. <br>
    <br>
    This simulation will give you all the basic information
    regarding the launch sequence and the incredible science
    and engineering behind it. <br>
    <br>
    I made sure to include as much accurate information
    as i could fit, without making it too technical or dull. <br>
    This is by no means and actual rappresentation of the
    real mission control UI, but it will give you a more than
    basic understanding of how humanity managed to achieve such
    an exciting accomplishment. <br>
    <br>
